# Syntax-Highlighter

A Python Syntax Highlighter that generates an HTML file with the highlighted code.

The program receives two files in console, one is a Python or txt file that contains the Python script to be highlighted and the other is the desired name of the output file.

The command line to run the code should look like this:

python programFileName.py inputFileName.txt/inputFileName.py outputFileName.html
